Work'n Share Web App
====================

_Note: This is the repository **only** for the web app of Work'n Share._

**Please use the "develop" branch and create new branches every time it's needed. NEVER EVER commit or push on "master".** This branch is reserved for the continuous integration.

The website uses Laravel 5.5, PHP 7.0 and MySQL 5.7.
We are using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) for the development environment with an Ubuntu 16.04 box.
